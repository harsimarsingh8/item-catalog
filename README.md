### About

This is the fourth project for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree. The Item Catalog project consists of developing an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories, as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. This project uses persistent data storage to create a RESTful web application that allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

A user does not need to be logged in in order to read the categories or items uploaded. However, users who created an item are the only users allowed to update or delete the item that they created.

This program uses third-party auth with Google or Facebook. Some of the technologies used to build this application include Flask, Bootsrap, Jinja2, and SQLite.
